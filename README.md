## Student Information
Name: Saumya Tandon  
Registration Number: 2427030368  
Program: B.Tech Computer Science & Engineering (Core)  
University: Manipal University Jaipur  
PBL Phase: PBL-2 (Semester 4)

## Project Domain
Healthcare | Artificial Intelligence | Machine Learning | Natural Language Processing

## Problem Statement
Patients and healthcare providers currently lack an integrated intelligent system capable of understanding natural language symptom descriptions while continuously learning from longitudinal patient history to provide personalized health insights and early risk detection.

## Project Overview
MediTrack is a healthcare-focused intelligent system that aims to bridge the communication gap between patients and clinicians by combining natural language processing with machine learning. The system is designed to accept symptom descriptions in natural language, analyze patient health data over time, and provide personalized insights and risk indicators.

## Background and Work Completed (PBL-1)
During PBL-1, the following work was completed:
- Comprehensive literature review of existing symptom checkers and healthcare AI systems
- Identification of research gaps in longitudinal patient health monitoring
- Finalization of project objectives and scope
- Preparation of detailed project roadmap, reports, and presentations

## Current Phase Focus (PBL-2)
The current phase focuses on design-level prototyping and system planning. The work completed in this phase includes:
- High-level system architecture design
- Definition of data flow between NLP, ML, and database components
- Conceptual design of patient symptom input and analysis pipeline
- Planning of database structure for longitudinal patient history
- UI/UX flow planning for patient-facing dashboard

## Prototype Design Summary
The conceptual prototype follows this workflow:
Patient Symptom Input → NLP Processing → Symptom Standardization → Historical Data Analysis → Risk & Trend Insights → Dashboard Output

This prototype represents a design and planning phase rather than a fully implemented software system.

## Planned Implementation (Upcoming PBL Phases)
- NLP pipeline implementation using spaCy and ClinicalBERT
- Machine learning models for health trend analysis and anomaly detection
- Backend service development using FastAPI
- Web-based dashboard development for visualization
- Continuous learning from historical patient data
- Progressive system testing and validation

## Tools and Technologies (Planned)
- Python
- spaCy, ClinicalBERT
- Scikit-learn, PyTorch
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL / MongoDB
- React.js
- GitHub for version control

## Repository Purpose
This repository documents the design, research, and prototype planning phase of the MediTrack project as part of PBL-2. Implementation and code development will be carried out incrementally in subsequent phases.
